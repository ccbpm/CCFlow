These five basic types are hereby further defined and/or restricted as to the number of developers, servers, geography locations and distribution method(s), depending on the specific product(s) being licensed by You.

In consideration of Your payment of applicable license fees and/or Your acceptance of the terms of this Agreement, e-iceblue hereby grants to You certain nonexclusive and nontransferable rights limited by the terms of this Agreement.
The Licensed Software is licensed (not sold) to You, for use strictly under the terms of this Agreement, and e-iceblue reserves all rights not expressly granted to You herein.

(a) each such Application must be marked with a prominent copyright notice bearing Your name as declared by You during purchase of the License;

All rights are reserved by e-iceblue.
Use of any objects outside of the context of this application is a violation of United States and international copyright laws and other applicable laws."

For each License Key provided to You by e-iceblue, depending on the specific license level selected by you at the time of purchase or most recent upgrade, You are granted a nonexclusive License to make the Licensed Software and/or the License Key(s) available either to the specified number of Your named developers or to an unlimited number of Your developers located at a single site (facility or campus) as indicated by e-iceblue and further explained below.
